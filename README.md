# Neumorphism Digital Clock

Neumorphism is a design trend that combines elements of skeuomorphism and flat design, resulting in a soft, realistic, and tactile appearance. In a neumorphic digital clock, this design style is applied to create a visually appealing and modern clock interface.

The digital clock consists of three separate boxes representing the hour, minute, and second components. Each box has a rounded shape with a soft shadow and a subtle gradient background, giving it a three-dimensional look. The colors used in the design are primarily light shades to create a clean and elegant aesthetic.

The hour, minute, and second boxes display their respective time values using large, bold digits in a contrasting color. The time is updated dynamically, providing an accurate representation of the current time.

Additionally, an "AM/PM" box is included to indicate whether the time is in the morning or afternoon. This box features the same neumorphic design style with a smaller font size for the "AM" or "PM" text.

The overall layout of the digital clock is centered on the page, making it visually balanced and pleasing to the eye. The glowing corner effect adds a subtle highlight and depth to the boxes, enhancing the neumorphic style.
